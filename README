Introduction
************

MC classifier is a super fast 16S rRNA gene fragment species level
classifier. For each 16S rRNA amplicon region a reference set of high quality
sequences known to be found in a given environment is used to generate a higher
order Markov chain models for each taxonomic ranks starting from reference
specie, corresponding genera, up to phylum level. A query sequence is first
classified at the phylum level and then through lower taxonomic ranks. At each
level the most probable model is accepted if the log odds of the probability of a
sequence being generated by the model is above certain threshold. Due to high
speed of MC classifier, the classification can be done on all reads even in a
large project.


Installation
************

Assuming that you are in the top level directory (containing this README file),
run

cd src
make

This will generated an executable 'classify' in the bin subdirectory of the top
level directory. Copy the executable to a directory included in your PATH
variable or add the path of the bin directory to your PATH variable.


Usage
*****

Here is an example of running classify on a fasta file of 10,000 vaginal Illumina
sequences from the V3-V4 region

   classify --rev-comp -i test10k.fa -d vaginal_319_806_rc_MCo7p2 -o mcDir

A count_tbl.pl scrip (located in the bin directory) can be used to generate a
sample x count contingency table

   count_tbl.pl -i mcDir/MC.order7.results.txt -o mcDir/spp.count.tbl.txt



The MC classifier can be run in a mode where all sequences are classified to
the species level by suppressing taxon error thresholding. To run MC classifier
in this mode, use --skip-err-thld flag

   classify --skip-err-thld -i test10k.fa -d vaginal_319_806_rc_MCo7p2 -o mcDir


To get more info about the classifier's options run

   classify -h
